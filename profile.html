    <h1>Saitama is the most powerful hero alive</h1> <p>Also known as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-Punch_Man">"One Punch Man"</a>
      because he can take down most adversaries in one punch, Saitama is just
      a guy who's a hero for fun, but he takes his hobby very seriously.</p>
        <img src="images/saitama/fly.gif" align="center">
      <p>He got to be so powerful by committing himself to a brutal training
      schedule of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and 100 squats along with running
      10km every single day.  He ate 3 meals a day, but only a banana as
      breakfast and also didn't use the air conditioner.  These daily activies
      strengthened his mental resistance and made him into the monster killing
      machine he is today.</p>

      <p>Saitama lives in City-Z and is constantly protecting it's denizens from
        evil and destructive monsters, like the mole people or aliens from
        far off outer space.</p>

      <p>He registered with the Heroes Association as a C-Class Superhero, much
      to his chagrin, and is tasked to defend Z-City from lowly monsters.
      Because Saitama is so single-minded in his quest to be a hero, he has
        neglected the popularity contests and public relations aspects of the
        hero business and so he is underestimated by the public, even though he
        saves their lives over and over again.</p>
      <p>Eventually, another hero, a cyborg by the name of Genos, adopts Saitama
        as his teacher, against Saitama's will.  Genos is another serious hero,
        but is much weaker than Saitama, however the public believes he is one
        of the most powerful heroes alive, because he did well on his exam when
        entering the Heroes Association.  Saitama did so well he broke the
        tests and got scored down because of it.
      </p>

      <p>Genos is no slouch, however, and boasts an array of weapons including
        powerful robotic limbs, lightning reflexes and an arsenal of differing
        artillery and rockets packed into his arms and body.</p>
            <img src="images/saitama/genos.gif" align="center">
      <p>Along with Genos and several of the other A-Ranked Heroes from the
        Heroes Association, the undervalued Saitama goes up against many
        mysterious monsters until he faces his ultimate rival: Boros.
        Even against the overwhelming strength of this ultimate enemy from a
        galaxy far far away, Saitama sadly can not find his match and defeats
        him with one punch.</p>

        <h2>An anime event so worth watching, even grandma and your cranky
          english teacher will thank you for sharing it with them.  Welcome to
          the world of One Punch Man!</h1>
